# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

The objective of this project was to identify and retrieve specific data from various websites. The goal was to retrieve information about mars such as recent news, images and some facts. The next task was to create and display the information on a Flask app.

In this project I learned the structure of an HTML file. With this information I am now able to identify specific parts of a website and use python to retrieve said data to then integrate it to a flask app.

## Results

The main result was the creation of a web page that showed all the information. In this page there is a button that is used to gather the most recent image of the red planet and the latest news. This page can be viewed in mobile devised, and also with the help of some bootstrap components, I manage to customize the look of the "scrape new data" button and make the image responsive.
